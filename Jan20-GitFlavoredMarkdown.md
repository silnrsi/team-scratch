#Styling Text

*Text preceded and followed by a single asterisk ( * ) is italic.*

**Text preceded and followed by double asterisks ( \*\* ) is bold.**

What if you need both bold and italics? Use the underscore for either one.

**Text preceded and followed by double asterisks ( \*\* ) is bold. _And this bit here is bold italic._**
