#Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets ( [ ] ), and then wrapping the link URL in parentheses ( ( ) ).

For example, to create a hyperlink to www.github.com, with a link text that says, Visit GitHub!, you'd write this in Markdown: [Visit GitHub!](https://www.github.com).
