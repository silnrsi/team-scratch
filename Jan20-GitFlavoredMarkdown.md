#Code Formatting
##Inline Formats

Use single backticks (`) to format text in a special monospace format. Everything within the backticks appear as-is, with no other special formatting.

Here's an idea: why don't we take `SuperiorProject` and turn it into `**Reasonable**Project`.

##Multiple Lines

You can use triple backticks (```) to format text as its own distinct block.

Check out this neat program I wrote:

```
x = 0
x = 2 + 2
what is x
```
