#Unordered Lists

You can use an asterisk or hyphen, followed by a single blank space, to denote a bulleted list item.

* Father
* Son
* Holy Spirit

It's recommended that you separate bullet lists with text or some other object in between. Otherwise, Markdown may conflate the two.

- Andika
- Charis SIL
- Doulos
- Gentium

If you want a sublist, indent list items as needed.
