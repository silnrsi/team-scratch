[BH] When I forked team-scratch, it got put under my context rather than silnrsi context. Presumably that is normal. Some questions:

1) Can I create a different fork (say for some other purpose) and if so what context will it be on?

2) Though it is on my context, I'm guessing everyone can see that I have forked it and view my fork -- is that right?
